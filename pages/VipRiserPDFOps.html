<h2>extract form fields/text</h2>

<p>This functionality is great for importing data from forms or re-editing text in a word processor.

<p>An alternative to publishing PDF as a web page is to turn in it into set of images. VipRiser offers an option to stitch resulting images together, which works great for multi-page PDFs.

<h2>turn PDF into a Web Page</h2>

<p>Due to the fact a PDF needs an external app/plugin to view it, publishing it online may not always be as straightforward as one would like.
Rendering PDF as a web page eliminates this problem by transforming it into a collection of HTML, CSS and image files that any web browser can view.
Furthermore, this makes it easy to embed your PDF with other HTML-based content like within a wikis, blogs or CMS.
