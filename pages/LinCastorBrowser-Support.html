<p>Frequently asked questions:</p>

<p>Q: What is difference between LinCastor and LinCastor Browser</p>

<p>A: Although both names are similar and LinCastor was inspiration for LinCastor Browser, purpose of these two apps is complementary, rather one replacing the other.
<a href="LinCastor.html">LinCastor</a> allows you to handle any URL scheme and also file extensions. It is also app which doesn’t have any visible UI, other than preferences setting.</p>

<p><a href="LinCastorBrowser.html">LinCastorBrowser</a><a href="https://onflapp.github.io/blog/pages/lincastor-browser.html"></a>on the other-hand, gives you possibility to configure which browser or app will be used to open a web link (http/https) you click on. This is something LinCastor could do with custom handler and bit of programming but LinCastor Browser does all of it in very user-friendly way.
Furthermore, LinCastor Browser works great for looking up text and displaying the result in web view panel.</p>

<p>Q: Can it handle non http links (e.g torrent magnets) like LinCastor</p>

<p>A: LinCastor Browser works with http and https links only. If you need to handle custom schemes or files, please use <a href="LinCastor.html">LinCastor</a>.</p>

<p>Q: How do I get LinCastror to handle links directly in my browser</p>

<p>A: Internal links clicks are handled by the browser itself. However, there are different ways around it:</p>

<ul>
<li>some browsers offer the ‘Services’ menu when you right click the link which can be used to pass the link to the LinCastor Browser</li>
<li>you can copy the link to the clipboard</li>
<li>you can drag the link to the LinCastor Browser</li>
